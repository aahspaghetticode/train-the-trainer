My new idea for training ais

# idea
create ai training script with a lots of params
give another ai control of those params
controller ai gets rewarded the average reward of top 5 population
wait
come back with fine-tuned training params

# todo
- [ ] create script that takes params from user script and feeds them to the training ai
- [ ] create example/testing user script
- [ ] manually fine-tune auto fine-tuning ai (confusing and ironic, but i mean, what else would i say?)
- [ ] improve UX
      If you would do any of these and make a pull request i would be extremely greatful.
